## Features

- **Tabbed Settings UI**: Right-click system tray > Settings... for configuration
- **Paint-style Following**: Cursor smoothly follows target position like drawing software
- **Follow Strength**: Configurable follow strength (0.05-1.0)
- **Ease Types**: Multiple easing curves (Linear, Ease In, Ease Out, Ease In-Out)
- **Delay Start**: Configurable delay start (0-500ms) before smoothing begins
- **Dual Mode**: Adaptive smoothing that responds to movement velocity
- **Target Cursor Types**: Circle or cross pointer shapes for visual feedback
- **Target Size**: Adjustable target pointer size
- **Transparency**: Configurable transparency levels
- **OBS Hiding**: Screen capture exclusion for streaming/recording
- **Always Visible Target**: Always visible mode or auto-hide based on distance
- **Hotkey Toggle**: Ctrl+Alt+S to instantly enable/disable
- **System Tray Integration**: Complete control through system tray interface

## Quick Start

1. **Run**: `mouse_stabilizer.exe`
2. **Configure**: Right-click system tray > Settings...
3. **Toggle**: Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` or right-click tray icon

## Settings

Access all settings through **Right-click system tray > Settings...**

### Basic Tab
- **Follow Strength**: Controls smoothing intensity
- **Ease Type**: Smoothing curve selection
- **Delay Start**: Wait time before stabilization begins
- **Dual Mode**: Velocity-responsive smoothing

### Visual Tab  
- **Target Cursor Type**: Circle or cross shapes
- **Size**: Target pointer size adjustment
- **Transparency**: Alpha blending control
- **Hide from OBS**: Screen capture exclusion
- **Always Visible**: Visibility mode control

### Debug Tab
- Advanced logging and diagnostic options

## Technical Specifications

- **Compatibility**: Windows 10/11
- **CPU Usage**: < 1%
- **Memory Usage**: < 5MB
- **Latency**: < 8ms real-time processing

## Troubleshooting

- **Settings not saving**: Ensure write permissions in application directory
- **Target pointer not visible**: Check transparency settings or always visible mode
- **OBS capture exclusion not working**: Try compatibility mode in Debug tab
- **Stabilization feels delayed**: Reduce delay start time or increase follow strength

## Architecture

Modular architecture with separated UI and core functionality:

- **Settings UI** (`settings_ui.c`): Tabbed configuration interface
- **Target Pointer** (`target_pointer.c`): Cross/circle visual feedback with capture exclusion
- **Stabilizer Core** (`smooth_engine.c`): Real-time smoothing algorithms
- **System Integration** (`tray_ui.c`, `hotkey.c`): Windows system tray and hotkey handling
